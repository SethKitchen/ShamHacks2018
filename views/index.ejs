								<h2>Recent additions</h2>
								<p>Above were some of the most popular items, but if you are looking for something different, below are the newest entries<br />
								</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-sitemap">
									<h3>VetStoreUSA</h3>
									<p>Dr. Josh Cotton, Navy research psychologist, reaches out to provide opportunities to retired veterans. Orriginally joined the navy to provide support to the troops needing to get boots onto hostile ground, helping to the best of his ability, only to discover a different opposition once troops returned home.  He continues to support service men, by connecting veterans to customers who are still in need of their occupational services. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-diamond">
									<h3>Diamond Dog Levitating Boots</h3>
									<p>CO Julio Sanchez was a Coast Guard Reserve, Senior Cyber Tech Sgt.  Blamed by his drill instructor for a lack of a specific ration element and subjugated to overly dramatic physical ramifications, dropped out.  Free of service requirements and driven by a dream proposed in "Back to the Future 2", used is cybernetic tech knowledge to tape magnets to his shoes and 'code' them to allow him to levitate at will! An opportunity like this will not last forever so act now, and get yours today!</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-tint">
									<h3>Puddle Pirate Popcorn</h3>
									<p>CEO Bob Bear, petty officer of the Navy, spent years on the USS Norfolk, bobbing around the pacific, where he spent his days fixing leaks and holes, but the nights were spent dealing out contraband junk food from home, trying to learn what was the most popular. With the knowledge of how much pre popped popcorn is loved, he returns home to continue brand he was ladled at sea, minus the sea salt on sailor hands. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-tree">
									<h3>Nice Hard Wood</h3>
									<p>Owner Mable Pines, Technical Sargent of the Air Force.  Nobody ever said how green West Virginia was, or how little there was to do in the area, beyond being taxing on the body with training and simulations, it was taxing on the mind to use time in a productive way, my calling was carving.  It started off just little momentous, but grew over time with experience and patience.  These days replicas, carvings, wood instruments are all options if given enough time to make them. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-shield">
									<h3>Vi-Gone</h3>
									<p>Lead developer Norton Soft, homeland defence captain. After 25 years of updating the national's cyber security systems, seeing the systems being offered to civilians to protect home computers and local systems was about the same as comparing a net to a wall.  While there were plenty of larger attacks and attempts which would get caught in it, there was a hole in security which needed to be filled, a friend from collage was starting a new software company, and looking for experience to provide a few more patches to their current offers. Come march, we'll do the equivalent of locking your computer's back door.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-wrench">
									<h3>Bath, Bath, and Beyond</h3>
									<p>Seaman Rusty Pipes.  For all your plumbing needs, "bath, bath and beyond" will be ready to not only provide pipes, parts, and stops, but for a limited time provide same week instillation for a reduced value.</p>
